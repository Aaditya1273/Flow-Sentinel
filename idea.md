🚀 The Full Idea: "Flow Sentinel"
Tagline: The World’s First Autonomous, MEV-Resistant Wealth Manager.

The "Big Problem" we are solving:


The "Post-Exploit" Anxiety: After the December 2025 exploits, users are afraid of "losing it all" to hacks.
The "Automation Gap": On Ethereum/Solana, "automated" DeFi relies on off-chain bots (Gelato/Chainlink) which can fail.
The "MEV" Problem: Front-runners steal value from users during large swaps.


The Solution:
Flow Sentinel is a smart-contract vault that doesn't just hold your money—it protects it and grows it autonomously. Once a user deposits, the Flow Blockchain itself becomes the "manager" of the funds.


Forte-Native Automation: It uses the new FlowTransactionScheduler to harvest, swap, and restake every 24 hours. No external bots. No servers. 100% on-chain.
MEV-Shield (Native VRF): It uses Flow's native on-chain randomness to "jitter" the timing of its trades. Bots can't predict exactly when the Sentinel will trade, making front-running significantly harder.
Emergency "Kill Switch" (Passkeys): If a user sees a market crash or a hack, they can instantly "Pause" all automated tasks using their iPhone FaceID/TouchID (Passkeys) via Flow’s native Account Abstraction.



📊 Winning the 50,000 FLOW (Judging Strategy)
To hit the maximum grant, we map your project directly to their 4 Judging Criteria:
CriteriaWhy "Flow Sentinel" WinsTechnologyIt uses Cadence 1.0, Forte Scheduled Transactions, and Native VRF. It's technically "unbeatable."Innovation"Ethereum needs Chainlink; Solana needs bots; Flow Sentinel runs itself." (This is your key marketing line).AdoptionWe focus on Consumer Web3. Using Passkeys means a user's grandma can use this without a seed phrase.EcosystemIt directly addresses the TVL focus of Round 2 by keeping capital locked in automated safety vaults.
💰 The 50,000 FLOW Grant Breakdown
Request this specific split to show you are serious about growth and security:

20,000 FLOW: Development of the Core Sentinel Engine (Forte & VRF Integration).
15,000 FLOW: Security & Auditing. Post-2025, Flow cares about this more than anything.
15,000 FLOW: Community Bounties. We will open-source the "Sentinel SDK" so other devs can build on it, creating a "Public Good" for the whole network.
